### Tools & Technologies Used
1. SQL -	Data cleaning, transformation, relationship building, and querying
2. Power BI -	Interactive dashboards and data visualization
3. Excel -	Data splitting and preprocessing

DAX Queries:
1.Average Order Value(AOV) = AVERAGE(Orders_Table[Sales])
2. Average Spent per Customer = DIVIDE(SUM(Orders_Table[Sales]),DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders_Table[Customer ID]))
3. Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit],[Total Sales])*100
4. Repeat Customer % = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(CustomersOrder,CustomersOrder[Order Count] >1)),
COUNTROWS(CustomersOrder)
)*100

5. Total Profit = SUM(Orders_Table[Profit])*100
6. Total Sales = SUM(Orders_Table[Sales])
7. CustomersOrder = SUMMARIZE(Orders_Table, Orders_Table[Customer ID],"Order Count",COUNTROWS(VALUES(Orders_Table[Order ID])))
